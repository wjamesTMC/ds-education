# Using Groups and Quantifiers

# Four clear patterns of entries have arisen along with some other minor problems:
  
# Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, 
# 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included. Some students measuring exactly 
# 5 or 6 feet entered just that number. Some of the inches were entered with decimal 
#  points. For example 5'7.5''. Our pattern only looks for two digits.

# Some entires have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
# Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
# Two students added cm.
# One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.
# It is not necessarily clear that it is worth writing code to handle all these cases 
# since they might be rare enough. However, some give us an opportunity to learn some 
# more regex techniques so we will build a fix.

# Case 1
# For case 1, if we add a '0 to, for example, convert all 6 to 6'0, then our pattern 
# will match. This can be done using groups using the following code:

yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")
# [1] "5'0" "6'0" "5'0" "5'"  "5''" "5'4"

# The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7, and 
# then end there ($). The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as \\1 to the 
# replace regex.

# Cases 2 and 4
# We can adapt this code slightly to handle case 2 as well which covers the entry 5'. 
# Note that the 5' is left untouched by the code above. This is because the extra ' 
# makes the pattern not match since we have to end with a 5 or 6. To handle case 2, 
# we want to permit the 5 or 6 to be followed by no or one symbol for feet. So we 
# can simply add '{0,1} after the ' to do this. We can also use the none or once 
# special character ?. As we saw previously, this is different from * which is none 
# or more. We now see that this code also handles the fourth case as well:

str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")

# Note that here we only permit 5 and 6 but not 4 and 7. This is because heights of 
# exactly 5 and exactly 6 feet tall are quite common, so we assume those that typed 
# 5 or 6 really meant either 60 or 72 inches. However, heights of exactly 4 or exactly 
# 7 feet tall are so rare that, although we accept 84 as a valid entry, we assume that 
# a 7 was entered in error.

# Case 3
# We can use quantifiers to deal with case 3. These entries are not matched because 
# the inches include decimals and our pattern does not permit this. We need allow the 
# second group to include decimals and not just digits. This means we must permit zero 
# or one period . followed by zero or more digits. So we will use both ? and *. Also 
# remember that for this particular case, the period needs to be escaped since it is 
# a special character (it means any character except a line break).

# So we can adapt our pattern, currently ^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$ to permit a 
# decimal at the end:

pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"

# Case 5
# Case 5, meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the 
# x.y to x'y. A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")
# [1] "1.7"   "1.8"   "2."    "5,8"   "5,3,2" "1.7"

# We will later check if the entries are meters using their numeric values.

# Trimming
# In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative. 
# These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard to see:

s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")

# This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to 
# removing them: str_trim.

str_trim("5 ' 9 ")

# To upper and to lower case 
# One of the entries writes out numbers as words: Five foot eight inches. 
# Although not efficient, we could add 12 extra str_replace to convert 
# zero to 0, one to 1, and so on. To avoid having to write two separate 
# operations for Zero and zero, One and one, etc., we can use the str_to_lower 
# function to make all words lower case first:

s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)

# Putting it into a function
# We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the 
# problematic cases. We can now put all this together into a function that 
# es a string vector and tries to convert as many strings as possible to a 
# gle format. Below is a function that puts together the previous code 
# lacements:

convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
    str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
    str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
    str_trim() #remove extra space
}

words_to_numbers <- function(s){
  str_to_lower(s) %>%  
    str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
    str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
    str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
    str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
    str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%
    str_replace_all("five", "5") %>%
    str_replace_all("six", "6") %>%
    str_replace_all("seven", "7") %>%
    str_replace_all("eight", "8") %>%
    str_replace_all("nine", "9") %>%
    str_replace_all("ten", "10") %>%
    str_replace_all("eleven", "11")
}

remaining_problems <- converted[not_inches_or_cm(converted)]
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*$"
